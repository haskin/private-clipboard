Private Clipboard is a Google Chrome Extension, designed to save the user's clipboard data locally and temporarily. Any copy action, either through "ctrl+c" or "right-click -> copy" is saved into local storage. The user can view the clipboard through the extension's popup to easily re-copy the text or delete it from storage. When the browser is closed, all the data is deleted.
